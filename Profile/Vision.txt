Lambda guides its clients through the process of creating an online business in the simplest, most practical way, by setting up the IT to automate a ton of the work. My intended audience are South African small business owners who want to experience the business design process integrated with technology in the most effortless way possible and with few to no prerequisite. Any third party service that I recommend, are very affordable and supports the local South African economy.
