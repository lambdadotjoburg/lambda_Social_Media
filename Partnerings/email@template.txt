Hi iKhokha

Below is a link to my first tutorial in a series of Business Intelligence tutorials.

Lambda works extremely hard to produce content which is rich, powerful, local and that would benefit everyone

My email is lambda@lambda.joburg
Alternatively another email that I often look at is admin@lambda.joburg or francois@lambda.joburg

I also have a gmail account lambdadotjoburg@gmail.com. I mainly use this one for social media etc.

I am writing to you, because I am in need of incentive either through iKhokha shareholders or to be pointed to the right person since obviously I display good talent and qualities that may benefit iKhokha and myself.

Regards
Francois @ Lambda
